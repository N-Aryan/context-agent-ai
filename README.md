# Context Agent AI

Context-aware RAG assistant for semantic retrieval, document understanding, and AI-powered contextual search using FastAPI, LangChain, and vector databases.

This project is designed to process documents, retrieve relevant contextual information using vector search, and generate structured AI-powered responses through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

---

# Features

- RAG-based contextual retrieval
- Semantic document search using embeddings
- FastAPI backend APIs
- ChromaDB vector storage
- LangChain-powered orchestration
- Conversational memory support
- Structured JSON responses
- Multi-document ingestion pipeline
